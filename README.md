This project will help you understand the core concepts of DDD such as Entities, Value Objects, Aggregates, Domain Services, Bounded Contexts, and Domain Events. You can also explore advanced DDD concepts like Event Sourcing and CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) as you get more comfortable with DDD.
